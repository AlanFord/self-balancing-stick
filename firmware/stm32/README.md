# Software

This software is derived from Mike Rouleau's work.  While Mike's work was designed for the Arduino IDE, this firmware is designed for an STM32 ARM
processor.  A prerequisite is Maya Posh's Nodate (野点) library - https://github.com/MayaPosch/Nodate.

This is still a work in progress and may not be fully functional.
