Libraries used in this project:

- Nodate
	Maya Posch's light-weight framework form STM32 - https://github.com/MayaPosch/Nodate
	This library provides a hardware API, replacing the need for the STM HAL.
	
- libshell
	One of several libraries found in S Stefan Wendler's libemb
	library collection: https://github.com/wendlers/libemb
	This library provides an environment needed to build an
	interactive remote shell.
	
- i2cdev
	This library provides an API for the MPU6050 accelerometer.
	The library can be found at
	https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/STM32HAL
	Jeff Rowbergs original code has been modified to work with
	the Nodate library rather than the HAL
